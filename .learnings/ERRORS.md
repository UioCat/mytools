## [ERR-20260714-001] ios-macos-development route lookup

**Logged**: 2026-07-14T19:16:00+08:00
**Priority**: low
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: config

### Summary
The macOS debugging route was first read from the skill root instead of its `routes/` directory.

### Error
```
cat: .../ios-macos-development/ios-debugger-agent/guide.md: No such file or directory
```

### Context
- Attempted to read the `ios-debugger-agent` route before rebuilding the SwiftPM macOS app.
- The actual file is `ios-macos-development/routes/ios-debugger-agent/guide.md`.

### Suggested Fix
Resolve route references relative to the skill's `routes/` directory or list skill files before opening a route.

### Metadata
- Reproducible: yes
- Related Files: none

### Resolution
- **Resolved**: 2026-07-14T19:17:00+08:00
- **Notes**: Located and read the route from the correct `routes/ios-debugger-agent/guide.md` path.

## [ERR-20260714-003] liquid glass offscreen snapshot rendering

**Logged**: 2026-07-14T19:45:00+08:00
**Priority**: medium
**Status**: pending
**Area**: tests

### Summary
SwiftUI `ImageRenderer` produced correctly sized but visually black images for Liquid Glass panels.

### Error
```
Generated PNG files contain no inspectable panel content even though rendering and pixel-size assertions pass.
```

### Context
- Rendered `ContextActionView` with macOS 26 `glassEffect` outside a live AppKit window.
- The effect depends on live window/backdrop composition and is not represented by the offscreen renderer.

### Suggested Fix
Use a launched packaged app and real `NSPanel` screenshots for Liquid Glass visual verification; keep offscreen snapshots only for size/smoke assertions unless a deterministic backdrop renderer is introduced.

### Metadata
- Reproducible: yes
- Related Files: Tests/MacToolsCoreTests/SuperPanelSnapshotTests.swift

## [ERR-20260714-002] super panel snapshot pixel assertion

**Logged**: 2026-07-14T19:44:00+08:00
**Priority**: low
**Status**: resolved
**Area**: tests

### Summary
Fractional point sizes render by rounding pixel dimensions up, while the snapshot assertion truncated them.

### Error
```
XCTAssertEqual failed: ("827") is not equal to ("826")
XCTAssertEqual failed: ("590") is not equal to ("589")
```

### Context
- Generated a 2x snapshot after increasing the translation panel to a fractional `4 / 3` scale.
- `ImageRenderer` produced the required enclosing pixel dimensions, but `Int(...)` truncated the expected value.

### Suggested Fix
Round expected rendered pixel dimensions upward before converting them to integers.

### Metadata
- Reproducible: yes
- Related Files: Tests/MacToolsCoreTests/SuperPanelSnapshotTests.swift

### Resolution
- **Resolved**: 2026-07-14T19:44:00+08:00
- **Notes**: Updated both pixel assertions to use `rounded(.up)`.
